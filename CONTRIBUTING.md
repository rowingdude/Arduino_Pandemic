## Code Structure

- **Organize** your code into functions that perform specific, discrete tasks.
- **Modularity** is crucial: if a function can be reused, place it in an appropriate module or library file.
- **File Naming**: Use clear and descriptive names for files and directories to reflect their contents and roles within the project.

## Functionalization

- **Single Responsibility**: Each function should perform a single, well-defined task.
- **Input and Output**: Functions should take inputs via parameters and return outputs. Avoid using global variables unless absolutely necessary.
- **Function Length**: Keep functions concise. If a function exceeds 30 lines, consider refactoring it into smaller functions.

### Example:

```cpp
void initializeLEDs() {
  // Initialize the LED strip with default settings
  // Set all LEDs to off state and apply configurations
}  // Function initializes the LED strip
```

## Branchless Code

- **Predictable Execution**: Aim to write code with as few branches (e.g., `if`, `else`, `switch`) as possible.
- **Use Lookup Tables**: Where appropriate, replace conditional logic with lookup tables or mathematical operations.
- **Avoid Deep Nesting**: Keep the nesting level shallow by early returns or by refactoring complex conditions into simpler functions.

### Example:

Instead of:

```cpp
void updateLEDColor(int condition) {
  if (condition == 1) {
    setColorRed();
  } else if (condition == 2) {
    setColorGreen();
  } else {
    setColorBlue();
  }
}  // Function to update LED color based on the condition
```

Use:

```cpp
void updateLEDColor(int condition) {
  const Color colors[] = {BLUE, RED, GREEN};
  setColor(colors[condition % 3]);
}  // Function updates LED color using a lookup table
```

## Comments

- **After Function Closing Bracket**: All comments should be placed immediately after the closing bracket of a function.
- **Brief and Descriptive**: Comments should succinctly describe what the function does without repeating the function name or parameters.
- **Avoid Inline Comments**: Place comments after functions, not within the function body unless absolutely necessary.

### Example:

```cpp
void initializeButton() {
  pinMode(BUTTON_PIN, INPUT_PULLUP);
}  // Function initializes the button with pull-up resistor
```

## Testing -- To be created

- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for every new function. Ensure that all edge cases are covered.
- **Hardware Testing**: If your changes affect hardware behavior, test them on real hardware and document the results.
- **CI Integration**: Ensure that your code passes all Continuous Integration (CI) checks before submitting a pull request.

## Pull Requests

- **One Change per Pull Request**: Each pull request should be focused on a single change or improvement.
- **Descriptive Titles**: Use clear and descriptive titles for your pull requests.
- **Commit Messages**: Write concise and informative commit messages.
- **Review Process**: Be responsive during the review process. Address feedback promptly and update your pull request as needed.

## Code of Conduct

Please adhere to our [Code of Conduct](link-to-code-of-conduct) to maintain a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors.
