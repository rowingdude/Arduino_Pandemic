# Arduino_Pandemic

Welcome to Arduino_Pandemic! This project is an open-source initiative aimed at [brief description of the project's purpose or goal]. Whether you're here to use the project, contribute, or simply explore, we're glad to have you!

**I have no contact, experience, or other outreach with the creators or owners of the Pandemic (C) board game. This project exists solely to automate our tabletop gameplay, it is not meant to replace the actual game!**

## Introduction

Arduino_Pandemic is designed to [briefly explain what the project does, e.g., "help manage and visualize game state in real-time using LED displays"]. Our goal is to create a robust and flexible tool that can be used by developers, hobbyists, and enthusiasts alike.

Whether you're interested in using the project for your own purposes or contributing to its development, we welcome you to join our community.

## Project Model    

Currently, we're developing the code here on Github and then we're modeling/testing it on Wokwi and TinkerCAD. 

[Wokwi link](https://wokwi.com/projects/382302255045529601)
[TinkerCAD link](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/7ZGFPbea1wG-arduino-pandemic)

## Usage

The project is highly customizable. You can adjust parameters, add new functionalities, or modify existing ones to suit your needs. Some key areas where you can start:

- **Modifying LED Patterns**: Adjust the colors, patterns, or timing of the LEDs.
- **Customizing Game Logic**: Add new rules or features to the game.
- **Expanding the Project**: Integrate additional hardware like sensors or more complex input methods.

For detailed instructions, refer to the inline documentation within the code.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether it's fixing a bug, adding a feature, or improving documentation, every bit helps. Please check out our [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/rowingdude/Arduino_Pandemic/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) before getting started.
